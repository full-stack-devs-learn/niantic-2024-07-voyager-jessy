Class: Rectangle

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        there were no parameters in the area or perimeter method,

        Where was the bug? (function, line number):
        getArea line 40 and getPerimeter 49

        What test helped you find the bug?
        just the java redline indicator, I couldn't call .getArea in
        my first test with any arguments without creating a new getArea method

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        I added both int height and int width as arguments to both
        getArea and getPerimeter methods

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
         actual and expected differed by 10.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
         the return value in getPerimeter was only adding width and height and not calculating the proper calculation for perimeter


        What test helped you find the bug?
        rectangle_shouldReturn_perimeterOfRectangle()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        I changed the return value of getPerimeter

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
         getArea didn't return zero if either the width or height
         was less than or equal to 0

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
         in the body of getArea (42-45)

        What test helped you find the bug?
        rectangle_shouldReturn_areaOfRectangle

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        I added logic to account for the desired return value of zero
        if either width or hieght was 0 within the getArea method

     Bug 4:

            Describe the bug/error:
             class variables were supposed to be private not public

            Where was the bug? (function, line number)
             5-6 on Rectangle

            What test helped you find the bug?
            jane :)

            What did you do to fix the bug?
            I changed them to private




Class: Quiz

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        this one drove me crazy. I couldn't figure out why I kept returning 0 on quiz_shouldReturn_quizPercent() regardless of what I input or changed, turns out it was a error in the math on line 40 of getPercent


        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        line 40 of the getPercent method

        What test helped you find the bug?
        quiz_shouldReturn_quizPercent() as I said before, I probably ran the debugger 50 times watching where it held values then lost everything with a return of actual = 0.

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        I changed the return equation to be (score*100) / possiblePoints

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        no logic available to not allow for score to never be negative


        What test helped you find the bug?
        when I added a negative number into my test it attempted to calculate it when I wanted it to return 0


        What did you do to fix the bug?
        i added the logic into the getPercent so that it would need to go through that to not allow score to be negative, but also cover the logic for getLetterGrade
